# EvolBERNPINN2D
Implementation of PINN for the solution of an evolutive hyperbolic problem of a Bernoulli beam
# Known problems
- plots-> plot_solution not working
- initial conditions do not converge
- quadrature rule not really defined
# To be implemented
## short term
- ~separate curriculum training into its own function~
- implement plot
- material parameters definition directly in JSON file: improve consistency
## long term
- comparison with closed-form analytical solutions
- try to implement positional embeddings
