# EvolBERNPINN2D
Implementation of PINN for the solution of an evolutive hyperbolic problem of a Bernoulli beam
# Known problems
- plots-> plot_solution not working
- initial conditions do not converge
# To be implemented
- quadrature rule not really defined
- comparison with closed-form analytical solutions
- try to implement positional embeddings
