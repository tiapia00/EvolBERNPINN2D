# EvolBERNPINN2D
Implementation of PINN for the solution of an evolutive hyperbolic problem of a Bernoulli beam
# Known problems
- plots-> plot_solution not working
- initial conditions do not converge
- quadrature rule not really defined
# To be implemented
## short term
- separate curriculum training into its own function
## long term
- comparison with closed-form analytical solutions
- try to implement positional embeddings
