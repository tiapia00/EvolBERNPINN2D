# EvolBERNPINN2D
Implementation of PINN for the solution of an evolutive hyperbolic problem of a Bernoulli beam
## Usage
- all parameters regarding the model (material, NN configuration) are defined in par.py
- there's one standard NN that is used to pretrain the PINN, controlled by retrain_init bool
- retrain both NNs every time parameters in par.py are changed
- script just write pictures in the various folders; don't expect to pop up during execution!
- main script to run: main.py
## Logging
- logs and plots are automatically created in the folder of the respective run (no popups)
- tensorboard can be used to open the logs created in model/logs
## Branches
- self_adapt: adaptive weighting of the various loss terms (most updated)
- main: hard encoding still present
- integrat: implementation of Simpson rule
- implement_batch: at some point, try to implement batching
