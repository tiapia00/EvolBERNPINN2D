Measurement units:
    mu: MPa
    E: Pa, initialization model expects an input of this type
    rho: kg/m^3
    all lengths in mm
    
just independent material parameters are inputted in par, function transforms then into the required parameters suitable for the eqns. to be solved
Notice beam.py accepts all dimensions in m
